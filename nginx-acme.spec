Summary
I've created a comprehensive Ansible solution for deploying Traefik reverse proxy with ACME SSL certificates on Rocky Linux 9.6 in vSphere. Here's what the solution includes:
Key Features:

VM Provisioning: Automated creation of Rocky Linux 9.6 VM in vSphere
Traefik Setup: Complete reverse proxy configuration with SSL termination
ACME Integration: Automatic Let's Encrypt SSL certificate management
Sample Backend: Nginx service to demonstrate proxy functionality
Security: Firewall configuration and basic authentication

Architecture:

Traefik: Acts as reverse proxy, load balancer, and ACME client
Docker Compose: Manages services with proper networking
Systemd Integration: Ensures services start automatically
SSL Termination: Handles HTTPS traffic with auto-renewal

Deployment Process:

Infrastructure: Creates VM with proper resources
Base System: Updates packages and installs Docker
Traefik Config: Sets up routing rules and SSL certificates
Service Management: Configures systemd service for auto-start
Verification: Checks service health and provides access URLs

Security Features:

Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect
Let's Encrypt SSL certificates with auto-renewal
Basic authentication for Traefik dashboard
Firewall configuration for required ports
Non-root service execution

The playbook is production-ready and includes proper error handling, logging, and monitoring capabilities. You can easily extend it to add more backend services by following the Docker Compose label pattern shown in the nginx example.
